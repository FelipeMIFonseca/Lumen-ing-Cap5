                          The family is one of the oldest institutions and it has always come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. At the beginning of times, the role of the family was not affective or emotional. This did not mean, though, that love was absent; it means that sentiment was not the main reason that kept the families together – survival was. The main objectives of families in the past were promoting the conservation of goods; carrying out ordinary responsibilities or a particular office; providing mutual help in times of crisis; and protecting people’s honor or lives.  <br>
                          With cultural, social and economic transformations, new family structures have emerged, and they aim at establishing an environment of affection, solidarity, loyalty, confidence, respect and love. While the traditional family unit of mom, dad and kids isn’t extinct, more modern configurations have been rapidly taking form in the past decades. <br>
                          Today’s modern families are often blended with a combination of parents, stepparents, siblings, stepsisters or stepbrothers, half-siblings shared with one biological parent, and even stepgrandparents, as well as grandparents, aunts, and uncles. Essentially, family means the people we have a sense of attachment to and connection with.

The personal pronouns are used to indicate people, places and objects. Each of the English personal pronouns shows us the grammatical person, gender, number, and case of the noun it replaces. In English, personal pronouns are classified into <b>subject</b>  and  <b>object pronouns</b>.</p>

                          <p class="general-text">The official label used by the Australian government to define a traditional family (a two-parent family with biological or adopted children only) is “intact”: Not damaged or impaired in any way. Complete. Whole. Unbroken.</p>
                          <p class="general-text">This is problematic when we think about all the other possible ways to live in a family: blended, step, single parent, foster, or any other family that diverges from we might call the “traditional” family model</p>
                          <p class="general-text">In Australian picture books, family representation has been overwhelmingly traditional; not just “intact”, but specifically white, middle class, with a mum, dad, and a (frequently blonde) male child protagonist. Children from diverse families are rarely represented.</p>
                          <p class="general-text">But this may be changing. The following are eight recently published Australian picture books that break the mould and celebrate family diversity, showing that all families – whatever shape they take – are intact.[...]</p>

[...] Not only does this book showcase a single parent family of colour, but it also shows a very different lifestyle and landscape to what many Australian children would be familiar with.</p>

Raised by her auntie, the book showcases family diversity in both formation and culture. The story examines the character’s feelings of loneliness and isolation in a country where everything is “strange”, including the language, which she doesn’t understand. To cope, she metaphorically wraps herself in a blanket of things that are familiar. After befriending a white Australian girl, she starts to make herself a new blanket with her newfound sense of belonging.</p>

                          <p class="general-text">This book tells the story of a young Aboriginal girl who is lost, but finds her way home to her people’s camp with the guidance of mother nature. Instead of having a mum and a dad, or one biological family, the story refers to the girl’s mothers, aunties, grandmothers, fathers, uncles and grandfathers. This book is unique in that it showcases a family type very rarely explored – traditional Aboriginal kinship groups.</p>

                          <p class="general-text">In this book, a father with early onset Alzheimer’s buys himself a camera and starts snapping pictures of the things that he wants to remember. This confuses and upsets his wife and son (who is telling the story), as he hasn’t taken a single photo of them. Eventually, the father passes away and leaves one photo behind – a photo of him with his wife and son – and they realise that he wasn’t taking photos of things he wanted to remember, but things he wanted them to remember about him. One photo examines both the illness and death of a parent in a touching and age-appropriate way.</p>

                          <br>
                          <p class="quote">Food shortage is a serious problem facing the world and is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The scarcity of food is caused by economic, environmental and social factors such as crop failure, overpopulation and poor government policies are the main cause of food scarcity in most countries. Environmental factors determine the kind of crops to be produced in a given place, economic factors determine the buying and production capacity and socio-political factors determine distribution of food to the masses. Food shortage has far reaching long and short term negative impacts which include starvation, malnutrition, increased mortality and political unrest1. There is need to collectively address the issue of food insecurity using both emergency and long term measures.</p>

                          <p class="titulo4 ml">Causes of food shortages</p>
                          <br>
                          <p class="quote">There are a number of social factors causing food shortages. The rate of population increase is higher than increase in food production. The world is consuming more than it is producing, leading to decline in food stock and storage level and increased food prices due to soaring2 demand. Increased population has led to clearing of agricultural land for human settlement reducing agricultural production (Kamdor, 2007). Overcrowding of population in a given place results in <br>
                            urbanization of previously rich agricultural fields. Destruction of forests for human settlement, particularly tropical rain forest has led to climatic changes, such as prolonged droughts and desertification. Population increase means more pollution as people use more fuel in cars, industry, domestic cooking. The resultant effect is increased air and water pollution which affect the climate and food production. <br>
                            Environmental factors have greatly contributed to food shortage. Climatic change has reduced agricultural production. The change in climate is majorly caused by human activities and to some small extent natural activities. Increased combustion of fossil fuels due to increasing population through power plant, motor transport and mining of coal and oil emits green house gases which have continued to affect world climate. Deforestation of tropical forest due to human pressure has changed climatic patterns and rainfall seasons, and led to desertification which cannot support a crop production. Land degradation due to increased human activities has impacted negatively on agricultural production (Kamdor, 2007). Natural disasters such as floods, tropical storms and prolonged droughts are on the increase and have devastating impacts on food security particularly in developing countries. There are several economic factors that contribute to food shortage. Economic factors affect the ability of farmers to engage in agricultural production. Poverty situation in developing nations have reduced their capacity to produce food, as most farmers cannot afford seed and fertilizers. They use poor farming methods that cannot yield3 enough, even substantial use. Investments in agricultural research and developing are very low in developing nations. Recent global financial crisis have led to increase in food prices and reduced investments in agriculture by individuals and governments in developed nations resulting in reduced food production.

                          <br>
                          <p class="quote">There are a number of short term effects of food shortage. The impact on children, mothers and elderly are very evident as seen in malnutrition and hunger related deaths. Children succumb to hunger within short period as they cannot stand long period of starvation and they die even before the arrival of emergency assistance. <br>
                            There are also long term effects of food shortage. These include increase in the price of food as a result demand and supply forces. Increasing cost of food production due to the increase in fuel prices coupled with persistent drought in grain producing regions has contributed to the increase in the price of food in the world. Increase in oil price led to increase in the price of fertilizers, transportation of food and also industrial agriculture. Increasing food prices culminated in political instability and social unrest in several nations across the globe in 2007, in countries of Mexico, Cameroon, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Pakistan, Egypt and Bangladesh among other nations (Kamdor, 2007).

                          <br>
                          <p class="quote">There are some solutions to the problem of food shortage. There is need to reduce production of carbon emissions and pollution to reduce the resultant climatic change through concerted and individual efforts. There is need to invest in clean energy such as solar, nuclear, and geothermal power in homes and industries, because they don’t have adverse effects on the environment (Kamdor, 2007). Rich nations should help poor nations to develop and use clean and renewable energy in order to stabilize green house emissions into the atmosphere (Watson, nd). Government need to work in consultation with climatic bodies, World Bank and the UN to engage in projects aimed at promoting green environment.</p>

                          <p class="titulo4 ml">Conclusion</p>
                          <p class="quote">Causes of food shortage are well known and can be solved if appropriate measures to solve the problem are taken and effectively implemented. Environmental causes of food shortages are changes in climatic and pollution due to human activities such overgrazing4 and deforestation which can be controlled through legislation.</p>

                          <h5 class="titulo4 ml">AUGMENTATION OF BRAIN FUNCTION: FACTS, FICTION AND CONTROVERSY</h5>
                          <p class="quote">Augmentation of brain function is no longer just a theme of science fiction. Due to advances in neural sciences, it has become a matter of reality that a person may consider at some point in life, for example as a treatment of a neurodegenerative disease. Currently, several approaches offer enhancements for sensory, motor and cognitive brain functions, as well as for mood and emotions. Such enhancements may be achieved pharmacologically, using brain implants for recordings, stimulation and drug delivery, by employing brain-machine interfaces, or even by ablation of certain brain areas.</p>
                          <p class="quote">In this Research Topic, we welcome papers critically evaluating the existing methods of brain augmentation, introducing new approaches and probing particular parts of brain circuitry and particular neuronal mechanisms as candidates for an enhancement. We welcome scientists from different fields: from neuroscience of microcircuits to systems neuroscience of large-scale networks and neural engineering. The work can be experimental or computational. Reviews and papers on philosophical and ethical issues are also welcome.</p>
                          <p class="quote">While the scope of possible relevant topics is broad, the authors are encouraged to clearly indicate how their studies address the announced theme of brain augmentation.</p>

                              <p class="quote">Krumulus, a small bookstore in Germany, has everything a kid could want: parties, readings, concerts, plays, puppet shows, workshops and book clubs. <br>
                                “I knew it was going to be very difficult to open a bookstore, everyone tells you you’re crazy, there will be no future,” says Anna Morlinghaus, Krumulus’s founder. Still, she wanted to try. A month before her third son was born, she opened the store in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district. <br>
                                BERLIN — On a recent Saturday afternoon, a hush fell in the bright, airy “reading-aloud” room at Krumulus, a small children’s bookstore in Berlin, as Sven Wallrodt, one of the store’s employees, stood up to speak. Brandishing a newly published illustrated children’s book about the life of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press, he looked at the crowd of eager, mostly school-aged children and their parents. “Welcome to this book presentation”, he said. “If you fall asleep, snore quietly”. Everyone laughed, but no one fell asleep. An hour later, the children followed Wallrodt down to the bookstore’s basement workshop, where he showed them how Gutenberg fit leaden block letters into a metal plate. Then the children printed their own bookmark using a technique similar to Gutenberg’s, everyone was thrilled.
